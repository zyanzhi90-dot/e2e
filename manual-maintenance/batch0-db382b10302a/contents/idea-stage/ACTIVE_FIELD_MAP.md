# Active Field Map

coverage_status: SUFFICIENT
coverage_record:
research_effort_budget: {"completed_query_events": 49, "completed_read_events": 99, "canonical_decision_grade_evidence_cards": 82, "active_continuation_subset_completed": 19, "new_read_events_in_continuation": 0}
stopping_reason: The continuation reused all 99 verified read events and converted the complete 19-paper active subset into canonical decision-grade Evidence Cards, yielding 82 canonical cards. The added primary evidence materially extends the accepted taxonomy with constrained QP/MPC and SCBF predictive impedance, energy-aware predefined-time interaction, hierarchical and diffusion skill learning, human-intent adaptation, multi-objective phase stiffness learning, and physical-prior learned dynamics compensation. Four foundational or review sources are used only for taxonomy and lineage with explicit review-level epistemic boundaries. Remaining questions are now specific research problems rather than top-level landscape coverage deficits, so broader searching is unlikely to reorganize the map before problem generation.

## Field Core Purposes

## Consensus

```json
[
  "Impedance control is fundamentally a port-behavior problem; isolated tracking stability is insufficient for energetic interaction.",
  "Impedance/admittance causality, robot hardware and inner-loop dynamics materially constrain realizable behavior.",
  "Variable stiffness can inject energy, so learning or scheduling gains requires explicit stability/passivity treatment when such guarantees are claimed.",
  "Learning improves selected task performance and adaptation, but guarantees usually come from surrounding model, energy or constraint structure rather than the learned optimizer itself.",
  "Compliance, low measured force, boundedness, passivity, safe-set invariance and human safety are distinct evidence claims.",
  "Most modern results remain platform-, task-, model- and distribution-specific; broad deployment conclusions require failure-inclusive physical evaluation."
]
```

## Unresolved Contradictions

```json
[
  "Higher stiffness improves precision and task completion but can increase interaction energy and force; no universal schedule resolves the tradeoff.",
  "Passivity offers environment-robust coupled stability yet can be conservative; predictive and learning methods improve performance while adding model and computation dependence.",
  "Low successful-trial force is reported as safer behavior, but excluding failures can hide the force exposure most relevant to safety.",
  "Physical priors improve learned-model generalization, but physical consistency of one component does not certify the complete learned feedback loop.",
  "SCBF forward invariance and predefined-time convergence are formal properties of modeled systems, not direct evidence of injury avoidance or standards compliance."

{
  "coverage_status": "SUFFICIENT",
  "research_effort_budget": {
    "completed_query_events": 49,

  },
  "stopping_reason": "The continuation reused all 99 verified read events and converted the complete 19-paper active subset into canonical decision-grade Evidence Cards, yielding 82 canonical cards. The added primary evidence materially extends the accepted taxonomy with constrained QP/MPC and SCBF predictive impedance, energy-aware predefined-time interaction, hierarchical and diffusion skill learning, human-intent adaptation, multi-objective phase stiffness learning, and physical-prior learned dynamics compensation. Four foundational or review sources are used only for taxonomy and lineage with explicit review-level epistemic boundaries. Remaining questions are now specific research problems rather than top-level landscape coverage deficits, so broader searching is unlikely to reorganize the map before problem generation.",
